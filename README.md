Look at this army of followers
marching behind me.

0:00:26.737,0:00:30.292
While your foundation is shaking
under your nose.

0:00:30.392,0:00:34.066
A fear is engulfing your heart.

0:00:34.166,0:00:37.604
Your faith is shaking
amidst the gathering (of believers).

0:00:37.704,0:00:45.624
These are signs of an approaching torrent,
a storm in the making.

0:00:45.779,0:00:53.016
I am a traveler at this moment in time
who is about to write a new history.

0:00:53.116,0:01:08.173
I am Adam.

0:01:08.273,0:01:12.663
I am Adam. I am your father.

0:01:12.763,0:01:16.501
I am Adam, I am your plight.

0:01:16.601,0:01:20.058
I am Adam, I measure you.

0:01:20.158,0:01:26.184
I am Adam, I am your father..

0:01:29.790,0:01:31.649
I am your father.

0:01:31.772,0:01:35.605
O dumbhead! Why do you evade the topic
Shy away from telling the truth?

0:01:35.727,0:01:39.490
The talks of your prophet
make my ears bleed.

0:01:39.590,0:01:43.423
Stop diverting the topic. Talk straight.

0:01:43.523,0:01:47.309
I have a few questions,
for you to answer before you leave.

0:01:47.409,0:01:51.010
Why did your prophet covet a 6 year old?

0:01:51.110,0:01:54.984
Saw his future wife in his daughter-in-law?

0:01:55.084,0:01:58.685
The strength of 30 men
was only meant to move the bed.

0:01:58.785,0:02:02.456
When Umar teased Sauda,
the prophet chewed meat at best.

0:02:02.556,0:02:06.157
If he is epitome of kindness,
why is he so ruthless to non-Muslims?

0:02:06.257,0:02:10.056
His acts put Hitler to shame.

0:02:10.156,0:02:14.105
Join the stream to
hear more of his accounts.

0:02:14.205,0:02:17.707
The prophet of Allah had told:
<i>"Drink, but do not get drunk."</i>

0:02:17.807,0:02:21.501
Don't try to escape. I've just started.

0:02:21.601,0:02:25.444
Is it too much for you?
It's your Alla's turn now.

0:02:25.544,0:02:29.214
What kind of god you have
who teaches you how to lie?

0:02:29.314,0:02:32.938
Shows you fear of punishment
on petty mistakes.

0:02:33.038,0:02:36.943
Allah says "<i>Stay hidden in ambush.
Bring your weapons too.</i>

0:02:37.043,0:02:40.893
<i>When you meet non-Muslims on the way,
cut their heads off right away."</i>

0:02:40.993,0:02:44.556
What kind of god you have
who teaches such hatred?

0:02:44.656,0:02:48.303
If we do not believe in him,
he calls us donkey, dog and filth.

0:02:48.403,0:02:51.794
Listen, you too, O lady,
Choose your own rights.

0:02:51.894,0:02:55.890
Men are no longer your rules.
Select any four for yourself.

0:02:55.990,0:02:59.747
Half intelligence, half testimony,
half is inheritance promised to you.

0:02:59.847,0:03:03.634
In Islam you are naked when
not heavily clothed.

0:03:03.734,0:03:07.219
Still you defend Islam,
what compels you?

0:03:07.319,0:03:11.268
Your condition is like
chicken defending KFC.

0:03:11.368,0:03:14.485
You have put your faith
in a deceptive Allah.

0:03:14.585,0:03:19.092
I can prove from Qur'an that
your Allah is Devil himself.

0:03:26.197,0:03:29.844
I refer from commentaries of
Ibn-e-Kathir and Kurtabi,

0:03:29.944,0:03:33.458
but if you insist on denial,
I can also split your moon into two.

0:03:33.558,0:03:49.186
I am Adam.

0:04:00.152,0:04:04.369
Heartbroken, I lost my home
as well as my relatives.

0:04:04.469,0:04:07.977
What I believed to be true,
turned out to be an illusion.

0:04:08.077,0:04:11.794
I left my religion and
broke all ties with Allah.

0:04:11.894,0:04:15.727
Sea of tears emerged from my eyes,
I had to part with my homeland.

0:04:15.827,0:04:19.349
The arrogance built up on my mind
was burned down to ashes.

0:04:19.449,0:04:23.259
Having held the prophet in high regards,
my head was down in regret.

0:04:23.359,0:04:27.029
Irrespective of what I am today,
I am a misfortune for you.

0:04:27.129,0:04:31.027
Having rejected your blind faith
I am closer to the Truth.

0:04:31.127,0:04:34.678
Temptation of heaven could not
hold me back, I fear no hell.

0:04:34.778,0:04:39.191
You ordered my decapitation by Islamic law,
I used pen as my weapon.

0:04:40.150,0:04:59.318
<b>Adam: <i>"My immortality is in benefit
people receive from my work."</i></b>

0:04:59.906,0:05:05.278
I hold the crown of
Authority on the Apostates.

0:05:08.044,0:05:11.760
I hold the crown of
Authority on the Apostates.

0:05:11.860,0:05:15.600
Shroud of an Apostate
is my ornament.

0:05:15.700,0:05:22.989
These are signs of an approaching torrent,
a storm in the making.

0:05:23.089,0:05:30.962
I am a traveler at this moment in time
who is about to write a new history.

0:05:31.062,0:05:46.347
I am Adam.

0:05:46.447,0:06:17.279
There is no god but Adam and
Sahil is a messenger of Adam.

0:06:17.379,0:06:21.375
<b>Sahil: <i>"Speak only the Truth.
Prove us wrong before the Judgment."</i></b>
